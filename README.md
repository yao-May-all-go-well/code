## Implementation of the Algorithm
- **`single_file_process.ipynb`**: Demonstrates the preprocessing steps for a single file, providing an intuitive example of the signal processing workflow.  
- **`data_process.py`**: Implements batch preprocessing and feature extraction for signals.  
- **`extract_bispectrum.py`**: Focuses on extracting features from signals.  
- **`models`**: Contains the model definitions and related code used in the experiments.  
- **`train.py`** and **`main.py`**: Handle the training logic and overall workflow management, respectively.


## Dependencies and Requirements
The code depends on Python standard libraries `os`, `random`, `time`, and external libraries `numpy`, `librosa`, `scipy`, `torch`, and `matplotlib`.
